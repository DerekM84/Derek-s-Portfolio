                        What are your qualifications as a junior developer?
                </p>

                <p class="me">
                        I'm currently wrapping up the tail-end of my University of Arizona Full-Stack Flex Bootcamp
                        program. What this
                        means is that we are into the final phase and have already begun deploying full-stack apps to
                        live servers and
                        started creating a showcase portfolio. We will be ending with React, as it is such a very useful
                        language for
                        developing web 2.0 material.
                </p>

                <p class="interviewer">What skills did you develop at your university? </p>

                <p class="me">Every day spent there granted me access to more tools for web development, and heavy
                        exposure to the community and concepts. It really opened the door to potential design
                        implementation. </p>



                <p class="interviewer">What do you mean by tools? What languages specifically?</p>
                <p class="me">
                        We call it the MERN Stack, which includes MYSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. These are the key
                        languages, but I learned everything from the 3 commons (HTML, javascript, CSS) to supportive
                        software for development and testing and 3rd party libraries to add in and allow for additional
                        features.
                </p>

                <p class="me">
                        I have 2 favorite things right now, which are css creative design and also the connection of
                        each piece of a
                        full stack application. The way all of the files are outlined can be a very helpful part of
                        organized code layout. This is momentary, but I've really been enjoying all of the languages
