                        <p class="me" >
                                I started independently and loved it. The obvious step for me was to enroll in the University of Arizona program. So, I completed the intense coding bootcamp which gave me a serious boost in my skills. Now I'm much more confident about
                                working in both the front and back end. What that means is that I've practiced
                                everything from creating the first file in the Github repository to polishing,
                                deploying, and debugging an application.

                        <label for="toggle-2" class="interviewer">
                        What skills did you develop at the U of A bootcamp? 
                        </label>

                        <p class="me">Every day I learned new things, and every night I practiced them. It was rinse and repeat in the purest sense. This educational
                                phase gave me access to more and more tools for web development, and heavy
                                exposure to the community and concepts. It really opened the door to greater potential
                                in design
                                implementation. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-wrap">
                         <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" id="toggle-3">
                        <label for="toggle-3" class="interviewer">
                        What do you mean by gaining new tools?</label>
                        <p class="me">
                                The main thing about coding and development is knowing that a concept exists and where to find the documentation on how to implement it. In the bootcamp, we call the set of tools the MERN Stack... which includes MYSQL, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
                                These are the cornerstone languages, but I learned everything from common HTML,
                                javascript, and CSS to supportive
                                packages like jQuery, Bootstrap, Mongoose, and Sequelize.
                                I've learned how to build layouts with the MVC model, and leave room for expansion on each project.

                        <input class="checkbox" type="checkbox" id="toggle-4">
                        <label for="toggle-4" class="interviewer">
                                So what is your favorite tool?</label>
                        <p class="me">Well, React was an instant refreshment after working with dynamically created HTML and jQuery. It quickly became my favorite. But even still, I really like rounding out my skillsets, and another thing I enjoy is the fun of creating a custom CSS style with user experience in mind.
                                Flexbox grid layouts are great for the structure and mobile responsiveness.
                                All of this is a nice occasional break from the backend and server-side code and allows for that creative flow too. </p>
